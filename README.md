## Data Structures

Explore well-documented implementations of popular data structures, including but not limited to:

- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Heaps
- ... and more.

Each data structure includes a dedicated folder with clear explanations, implementation details, and examples.

## Algorithms

Discover a wide range of algorithms categorized by their use cases:

- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, QuickSort, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)
- Graph Algorithms (Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming
- Divide and Conquer
- Greedy Algorithms
- ... and more.

Just like the data structures, each algorithm comes with detailed explanations, implementations, and examples.
